                <h1>Pok Ta Pok</h1> <br>
                Pok ta pok, not just a sport, it's a legacy that players play to be connected to their ancestors. This game was played over 3,000 years ago. Players also have to prepare themself spiritually and mentally before a game because it's not like soccer or basketball, it can’t be played for 45 minutes like other sports. It is a very treacherous and hectic game. It shouldn’t be confused with Ulama (different court settings and rules), but the 2 are still generalized as the Mesoamerican hip ball game. 
                The painting on the players is not only for decoration, it symbolizes different ranks, gods, numbers, and differentiates the captain.

                <ol>
                <li><strong>1. Type of Game: </strong> <br>Pok Ta Pok was a Mesoamerican ballgame with ritual and sporting significance. It was played by civilizations like the Maya and Aztecs it's tied to mythology, politics, and religious ceremonies.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>2. Game Play and Rules</strong> <br>Players used their hips, some specific versions use elbows, or knees but not hands or feet to hit a heavy rubber ball. <br>
                The objective was to keep the ball in play and pass it through a vertical stone ring high on the court walls. <br>

                Points were likely scored by getting the ball through the ring or forcing the opposing team to miss. <br>

                The game could end after a set score or when a team scored a ring goal which sometimes immediately ended the match. <br> <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>3. Number of Players</strong><br> Teams are of 4 players per side. </li> <br>
                <li><strong>4. Materials:</strong> <br>
                The ball was made of solid rubber, sometimes from the rubber tree sap mixed with other plant materials, making it heavy up to 9 lbs.    <br>

                Court
                It was built from stone with a long, narrow playing alley flanked by sloped or vertical walls. The rings were usually carved from stone.    <br>

                The players are not allowed to hit the game with their head, just with their hips, knees, and elbows. <br> <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>5. Sacrifice: </strong> <br>
                Sacrifice the team that would be sacrificed to the gods would be the winning team it was seen as an honour to be sacrificed to the gods and it would only be acceptable to sacrifice the best.</li>
